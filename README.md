# Setup Instruction

This folder contains both the client folder and the api folder. Both use NodeJS and use npm for package management

To get the project running, you will need to clone the directory. Navigate into api and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. After that, navigate to the client directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

The client is running on port 3000 and the api is running on port 5000.
